# Lid-driven-cavity
# MATLAB simulation of Lid Driven Cavity using SIMPLE algorithm, the question discussed is as follows
A two-dimensional lid-driven cavity problem needs to be solved. The cavity has dimensions of 40 cm x 40 cm. The fluid within the cavity has a constant density and a kinematic viscosity (v) of 0.004 mÂ²/s. The walls at x=0, y=0 and x=40 cm are stationary. The horizontal lid at the top of the cavity (y=40 cm) moves steadily with a velocity of 1 m/s in the positive x-direction.
